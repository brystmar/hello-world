Don't fear the repo!

Find me at the intersection of food & tech.

Cultures are built around the dinner table.  Yet somehow, I feel like an outlier as an enthusiastic home cook.  Young Americans in my generation don't cook at home as often as their parents did.

Young people today grow up with easy access to food from every corner of the globe.  Ingredients once confined to specific regions (or even seasons) are now plentiful in every major city.

I love tools that make the cooking process easier, more enjoyable, and more accessible.  Let's figure out how to increase the share of people who cook at home.

GOAL: Promote a fun, positive experience with consistently delicious results.  We'll use carrots, not sticks.  Unless they're breadsticks.
